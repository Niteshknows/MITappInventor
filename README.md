# MITappInventor
These are my few projects I made in MIT App Inventor.

<h1>Translator App </h1>
This app translates English Language to French Language. It is made completely using App Inventor and is very user friendly.
<h2>Shake Wallpaper App</h2>
This app uses accelerometer sensors. The app changes imagewhen you shake your device. It is completely made using App Inventor.
